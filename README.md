# Page-Visibility-User-Script
Prevent websites from knowing if you have opened a new tab/window or if you are using a different application, etc. This userscript blocks the page visibility API and to some extent the old blur/focus APIs.

Example: Twitter stops playing videos as soon as you switch tabs. This userscript prevents that.

## Instructions
* Install a userscript extension like Violent Monkey.
* Open the extension settings, hit install from URL.

* Confirm Installation.
